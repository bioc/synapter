#+TITLE: synpater README/TODO           -*- mode: org; -*-

See https://github.com/lgatto/synapter/ and issue tracker for open/close issues and to report new ones.

* TODO [34/36]
 - [ ] return corresonding pep score for a given fdr.
 - [ ] calculate PEPs
 - [X] Look at EMRT matching (NA are an issue)
 - [X] filenames$hdmsefile should point to an 'MasterPeptides' rds file,
       that will be load'ed if master=TRUE (instead of read.csv'ed). 
       Will have to create a new field in .Synapter to store the second 
       master data.frame and access it if all(deltaRt == 0).
 - [X] Create small test data to include in package.
       There will also be some data packages.
 - [X] Documentation - describe methods
 - [X] use an "auto" mode for parameter selection: model and if multiple paires, use details
 - [X] Merge MatchedEMRTs slots from multiple Synapter instances - using MSnbase
 - [X] Fix/update html report to use Synapter class:
 - [X] add a css file
 - [X] Documentation - details section
 - [X] Documentation - add exporters in example
 - [X] aggregate peptide intensities into proteins; probably best 
       to create an MSnSet instance for this - see combine
 - [X] Add top3/topN aggregation method - rather in MSnbase
 - [X] Use a subset of the HDMSe peptides for the grid search 
       to speed things up.
 - [X] avoid repeating loess in gridSearch!
 - [X] Change report to make 4 parts clear 
       (1) data input
       (2) filtering (defined training set)
       (3) modelling
       (4) matching
 - [X] add qPlots and histograms for ppm and rt diffs
 - [X] Get the grid statistics from the actual EMRT matching.
 - [X] When doing grid search on model features, report percentage 
       of 1 correct match (as is), number of 0 matches, number of 
       2+ matches and number of 1 erroneous matches.
 - [X] Add a getEMRTtable method, like plotEMRTtable but with the 
       numbers
 - [X] Add validation: verify that the matched MSe Pep3D EMRTs
       are those that were effictively identified in MSe final peptide
       and calculate percentage
 - [X] filter on protein.falsePositiveRate
 - [X] add legend to detailed feature plot and svg tooltips with peptide sequence
 - [X] MOVE PPM ERROR FILTER TO INDIVIDUAL HDMSE/MSE DATA, INSTEAD 
       OF DOING THIS ON MERGED DATA.
 - [X] Proper (ref) class for data/analysis/results, see synapter-class.R
 - [X] additional filtering protein.dataDaseType %in% [Regular|Random]: 
       calculate FDR and filter - for pepFrag1 and pepFrag2 separately
 - [X] add 1, 2, 3 nsds on rt loess plot
 - [X] Add parameters for (a) filtering and (b) matching
 - [X] investigate huge delta rt 
 - [X] Add light version of result tables
 - [X] filtering as table
 - [X] new table for ppm

 - [X] plot rectangle in feature plot 
 - [X] add plot over full rt/mass range
 - [X] fix rtModel plot ranges
