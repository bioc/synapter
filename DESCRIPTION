Description: The synapter package provides functionality to reanalyse 
	     label-free proteomics data acquired on a Synapt G2 mass 
	     spectrometer. One or several runs, possibly processed with 
	     additional ion mobility separation to increase identification 
	     accuracy can be combined to other quantitation files to 
	     maximise identification and quantitation accuracy.
