Description: The synapter package provides functionality to reanalyse
    label-free proteomics data acquired on a Synapt G2 mass
    spectrometer. One or several runs, possibly processed with
    additional ion mobility separation to increase identification
    accuracy can be combined to other quantitation files to
    maximise identification and quantitation accuracy.
